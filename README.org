* jsdoc.el
Inserts [[https://jsdoc.app/][JSDoc]] function comments/typedefs easily. It also tries to infer types by itself while doing that. Type inference is quite primitive.

*NOTE* This branch contains an older version and is not updated. Use this if you don't have Emacs 29 with new tree-sitter support. If you are using Emacs 29 and above, please take a look at the main branch.

* Why?
- I was trying to find something to do with [[https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter][tree-sitter]] to learn it and I like to document my code. There you have it.
- For functions with JSDocs, LSP-mode will show us the types and function description in a neato pop-up to the side.

* Usage
Use the interactive command =jsdoc=. If the cursor is on a function definition, it inserts a JSDoc style function documentation comment. If the cursor is on a JavaScript object, it inserts a JSDoc =@typedef=.

* Installation

- [[https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide][ananthakumaran/tide]] :: The command =tide-jsdoc-template= inserts a JSDoc template for your function. It~s meant to be simple, no advanced stuff. It also requires ~tide-mode~ enabled (which runs ~tsserver~).
- [[https://github.com/mooz/js-doc][mooz/js-doc]] ::  Another package in the spirit of this one. Seems to have quite advanced stuff but didn't get it to work. Haven't got updated for a while.
